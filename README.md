# Iron Bank

A very basic banking system for Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, and my first mod ever.

## Features

- Global player bank account, accessible from every city.
- Gold deposit (with taxes)
- Gold withdraw (with taxes)
- Daily interests generation.
- Choose where your interests are deposited (your purse or your bank account).
- Configurable settings using [MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/612) (optional).

## Todo

- [ ] Loans, affected by renown (high renown means high loan capacity, more wars means higher cost)
- [ ] Overdraft, affecting by renown (a negative bank balance lowers your renown proportionally)
- [ ] Dynamic interests rate, affected by world stability (more wars means higher interest rates)
- [ ] Publish on [nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord)
